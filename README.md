# SDG 15: Life on Land - Global Deforestation Trends and Carbon Emissions

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global deforestation trends, forest types, and carbon emissions related to forest degradation. The goal is to provide insights into the impact of deforestation on climate change and biodiversity conservation, in line with **SDG 15: Life on Land**. The analysis explores key aspects such as tree cover loss, forest types, CO₂ emissions, and the role of fires in global deforestation.

## Key Points of the Work on SDG 15

- **Focus on SDG 15**: Analysis of global tree cover loss, forest types, and CO₂ emissions related to forest degradation.
- **Forest Type Distribution**: Visualizing the proportion of primary, regenerated, and planted forests across countries.
- **Tree Cover and Land Area**: Comparing forest coverage relative to total land area in countries like Brazil, Russia, and Indonesia.
- **Impact of Fires**: Analyzing tree cover loss due to fires and emphasizing its role in forest degradation.
- **CO₂ Emissions**: Exploring the link between deforestation and carbon emissions, highlighting high-emission countries.
- **Tree Cover Loss vs. CO₂ Emissions**: Correlating tree cover loss and CO₂ emissions, emphasizing the environmental impact of deforestation.
- **Insights for SDG 15**: Providing recommendations for sustainable forest management to combat climate change and protect biodiversity.

## Global Comparison of Forest Type Across Land Area
### Key Insights:
1. **Forest Coverage and Total Land Area**: Countries with high forest cover have significant responsibility for climate mitigation and biodiversity protection.
2. **Forest Type Distribution**: Countries with a larger proportion of regenerated forests are recovering from deforestation, while those with more primary forests are critical for biodiversity preservation.
3. **Tree Cover Distribution**: Essential for maintaining global ecological balance, regions with significant tree cover must prioritize forest conservation to avoid irreversible damage.

## Global Annual Tree Cover Loss from Fires
### Key Insights:
1. **Global Annual Tree Cover Loss Due to Fires (2000-2020)**: Forest fires contribute significantly to global tree cover loss, further accelerating climate change.
2. **Proportion of Tree Cover Loss Due to Fires vs. Other Causes**: While fires play a major role, other factors like agriculture and logging also contribute to deforestation.
3. **Tree Cover Loss Due to Fires by Region**: Brazil and Russia experience disproportionately high fire-related tree cover loss, underlining the need for stronger fire control measures.

## Global Distribution of Tree Cover Loss and CO₂ Emissions
### Key Insights:
1. **Tree Cover Loss vs. CO₂ Emissions**: Higher tree cover loss correlates closely with increased CO₂ emissions, reinforcing the need to prevent deforestation.
2. **CO₂ Emissions by Country**: Identifying countries with the highest CO₂ emissions linked to deforestation helps prioritize climate action.
3. **Global Tree Cover Loss and CO₂ Emissions by Region**: Geographic visualization highlights critical areas for climate action and forest conservation efforts.

## Conclusion
This project sheds light on the critical importance of forests in mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity. It emphasizes the need for global action to prevent deforestation and ensure sustainable forest management.

### Recommendations:
- Promote reforestation and afforestation initiatives in countries with significant forest cover loss.
- Implement stricter forest fire prevention measures in fire-prone regions.
- Encourage policy changes in high-emission countries to reduce deforestation rates and mitigate CO₂ emissions.
